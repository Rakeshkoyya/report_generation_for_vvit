# report_generation_for_vvit
This is the project to generate attendance report for my college by takeing attendance list of MS teams

This project is completed and deployed on heroku 
http://ainuggets-vvit.herokuapp.com/

As online classes came into play during covid, our college has an issue with attendance. they are taking classes on MS teams and the attendence file generated is not formatted properly,
as it only contain data who joined and left, with this file we can not get which students are absent 

This project take that crappy attendence file and turn it into complete report we all the data requried for attendence report by compare with database of students' data.

- pandas for operating with csv and excel files
- django as webframework
- bootstrap and css styling.
